            to receive a refund or a replacement. In the case of perishable
            goods, if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality or in the
            unlikely event that they are damaged, defective or incorrect, please
            contact us via support@oliveandgrain.com.au immediately. A member of
            our team will arrive to inspect the product, bringing a replacement

            exact, original condition in which it was delivered. For platters,
            this includes; the wooden board, the entirety of the platter
            contents and the box. Please note that, given the nature of our
            products, we do not provide refunds or exchanges where you have
